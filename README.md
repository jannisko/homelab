# Homelab

![deployed](https://github.com/jannisko/homelab/workflows/deploy/badge.svg)

A continuously deployed config for my homelab docker services running on a RaspberryPi 4.

This includes:
- media-server (Plex, Radarr, ...)
- git-server (Gitea, Drone, nginx-proxy)

This repository should only serve as inspiration, as there is a lot of configuration needed to get everthing running.
